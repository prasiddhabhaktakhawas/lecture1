## CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

# PROJECT-0 using HTML and CSS

## Description:
	<p align="justify"> This website is about me and my personal interests. It has 5 pages in total ( home, skills, gaming, movies , about). I have used Bootstrap in my website. You can navigate through pages from the navigation bar which always stick to the top of the page. At the bottom there is a footer containing my phone number, location and email address.</p>

## Home page:
	<p align="justify">I have created two columns in the first division. First column has a small description about me with a button and the second column has an image.
	In the second division, I have written about my interests. There are 6 row 2 columns. First column of each row has an image and second column of each row has a progress bar with some text.</p>

## Skills page:
	<p align="justify">Here I have made a grid table about the languages and APIs that I have learnt. The table has 10 rows and 3 columns. First column has logo of languages, second column has name of the languages and the third column has level of experience in those languages.</p>

## Gaming page:
	<p align="justify">Here I have given description about my experience playing video games. Below that, I have created a division with 4 rows and 4 columns and placed an image in each cell.</p>

## Movies page:
	<p align="justify">Here I have listed the best movies that I have watched so far. It is a ordered list.</p>

## About page:
	<p align="justify">In this page, I have given some information about myself and some links that leads to my different social media and other accounts. They are fake links. They just redirect to the respective website.</p>


## Mobile Responsiveness:
	I have made my website mobile responsive too in following ways:

*	In the home page, the number of columns occupied by the contents change. When the window width decreases the image comes down and the size of the images and icons changes. The font size of my interests and its description decreases.
*	In the skills page, the text size of the description decreases and the table shrinks as I have used grid table. The size of the logos also changes.
*	In the gaming page, the size of text changes and only 1 game is displayed in 1 row.
*	In the movies page, the font size of the description and the list decreases.
*	In the about page, the font size of the description decreases.
*	The font size of the navigation menu decreases and the icons in the footer and its corresponding text also decreases in size. In addition, the columns taken by element of the footer also changes.
